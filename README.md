## Successorator Description
Successorator is an Android app that will function as a TO-DO list for a user. 
They will be able to add goals to a list that will rollover to the next day if not completed.
They can tap on any goal to mark it as finished so it is moved to the bottom of the list.

## Velocity Calculation
End of Milestone 1 -> Milestone 2:

~~See todayâ€™s date (3), goal rollover (4), re-add a removed goal (5), Persistence (6), Mock Date Button (2)~~ = 20 hours of work done

20 hours of work done / (6 people * 8 hours of work per iteration) = 0.42 velocity

Fix MainActivity (2), Goal Recurrence Options for Current Date (3), Selecting Success List view (3), Goal Creation in Recurring View (4), Goal Creation in Pending View (3), Developer Story for testing Iteration (2) = 17 hours of work.

6 people * 7 hours of work per iteration * 0.42 velocity = 17.5 hours

We will be on track to finish all of the required tasks by the end of iteration 1 of Milestone 2 at this velocity if we all work the same amount of hours as iteration 2 of Milestone 1 and we are still utilizing week length iterations. We will continue to use week length iterations since it is easy to keep track of and we have a little bit over two weeks to finish milestone 2.

End of Iteration 1 -> Iteration 2:

~~Fix MainActivity (2), Goal Recurrence Options for Current Date (3), Selecting Success List view (3), Goal Creation in Recurring View (4), Goal Creation in Pending View (3), Developer Story for testing Iteration (2)~~ = 17 hours of work done.

17 hours of work done / (6 people *  7 hours of work per iteration) = 0.4 velocity

Tagging goals with contexts (4), Focusing on goals by context (4), Add Editing Options to Pending (3), Add Delete Option to Recurring (2), Developer Story for testing Iteration (2)
= 15 hours of work

6 people * 6.5 hours of work per iteration * 0.40 velocity = 15.5 hours

We will be on track to finish all of the required tasks by the end of iteration 2 at this velocity as long as we all work 6.5 hours each week. We have already been working 7 hours each per week, so we should not have any issues.
